# Darwin World Simulation

## Description
This project is a simple simulation of Darwinian evolution. Animals move around the map, eat grass, reproduce, and try to survive. The most important aspect of the simulation is the animal's energy — if it drops to 0, the animal dies.

Each animal has a genome, for example: [2, 5, 6, 2, 4]. It determines how the animal moves across the map. The simulation includes charts that present interesting dependencies and patterns observed during the simulation.

There are also two optional features that can be enabled:

Owlbear – a special creature that occupies its own territory. If an animal enters the same position as the Owlbear, it dies.

SlightCorrection – a special type of mutation that occurs during reproduction.
